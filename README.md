# Customer-Service-Question-Answering-Chatbot (DL1)
Dataset: Multilingual Customer Support Tickets
Goal: Develop a chatbot capable of answering customer support questions. The current implementation uses one method: fine-tuning a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model (T5). A second method — retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) — will be added in the next stage of the project for comparison.
